                386BSD  is an experimental research system intended for
          exploration and study. The inclusion of source  code  allows
          the creative and industrious student of operating systems to
          modify, correct, augment and otherwise alter the  system  in
          any   manner   desired,  and  thus  is  made  available  for
          informational purposes only.  Due to the  unique  nature  of
          386BSD  releases,  we cannot provide "on-demand" support. If
          you have critical support needs, we suggest the purchase  of
          a  commercial  binary  systems  product from a major systems
          vendor
